## 🧩 Task 03 - Sudoku Solver GUI (SCT_SD_3)

This is **Task 3** of my Software Development Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.



### 👩‍💻 Task Details  
Created a **Java-based Sudoku Solver GUI** using **Swing**. This application allows users to input values into a 9x9 Sudoku grid, validates the current state, and gives instant feedback on the puzzle's correctness. It emphasizes **input validation**, **keyboard interaction**, and **GUI logic**.


### 🚀 Features  
✅ Pre-filled Sudoku puzzle  
✅ Editable cells with single-digit restriction (1–9)  
✅ Prevents duplicate entries in rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes  
✅ Arrow-key navigation between grid cells  
✅ Button to validate the puzzle  
✅ Feedback messages:
- ✅ Valid & Complete: *"Sudoku puzzle solved!"*  
- ⌛ Valid but Incomplete: *"So far correct. Keep solving!"*  
- ❌ Invalid Puzzle: *"Duplicate entries found."*

### 🧠 Concepts Used  
- `Swing` GUI components  
- `GridLayout` for Sudoku grid  
- `DocumentFilter` for input restriction  
- `KeyListener` for arrow key navigation  
- Logical validation of Sudoku board  
- Event-driven GUI programming

### 📁 Files  
- `SudokuSolver.java` — Main Java file with GUI and validation logic


### 📌 Output Example  
🧮 A 9x9 Sudoku grid window with:  
🟩 Pre-filled and editable cells  
🕹️ Keyboard navigation (↑ ↓ ← →)  
🧪 Solve button with validation  
📢 Message dialogs for feedback
